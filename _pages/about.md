I am a PhD Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida specializing in Artificial Intelligence research,
with a focus on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

My work involves building and evaluating AI systems, research-grade machine learning pipelines, and large-scale experiments.
I have experience running both open- and closed-source LLM inference via APIs and local/cluster-based execution.

I am currently seeking AI Research and Machine Learning internship opportunities.
